# [Thunderbolt Mac Pro Early 2009 with Gigabyte GC-Alpine Ridge Card](https://ameyrupji.github.io/thunderbolt-macpro-5-1/GC-AlpineRidge.html)

This is my story to add Thunderbolt support to my Mac Pro Early 2009 (5,1) with a Gigabyte GC-Alpine Ridge Card. Before we begin a quick disclaimer below.

**Difficulty Level:** Medium

This is not a end all be all guide for getting the GC-Titan Ridge thunderbolt card working for every use case. These steps have worked for me but there might be additional steps that might be required for getting other thunderbolt devices to work.
