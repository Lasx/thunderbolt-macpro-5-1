## My Thunderbolting Story 

I was in the market looking around for a PCIE based solution for running my Apple Thunderbolt Displays off of. I found the following options which look compelling looking at the reviews:

- ASUS Expansion Card for Z170 & X99 Motherboards ThunderboltEX 3 [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HDUVJ54/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ~$60.
- Gigabyte GC-Titan Ridge (Titan Ridge Thunderbolt 3 PCIe Card Component) [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GBZL93X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ~$100.

Tried both these cards on my system and this are my thoughts:

- ASUS ThunderboltEX 3: Click [here](ThunderboltEX3.md) [Work In Progress] for my findings.
